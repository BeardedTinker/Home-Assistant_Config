## /panels/iframes folder

All "external" components of the Home Assistant that I want to have available in left side panel are listed in this folder.

WARNING: If you are accessing Home Assistant over HTTPS using SSL, you cannot access HTTP sites through an iframe panel.

Panels that have .disabled have been removed as I don't use external components for that anymore.
