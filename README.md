# BeardedTinker's Home Assistant configuration

Here is a shot on making my Home Assistant configuration available.
All individual files should have comments inside and I'll try to add as much documentation as I can over time.

## Want to get more info?

You can follow my YouTube channel (https://YouTube.com/BeardedTinker) for more information and video guides for various stuff that's included here. 

If you want to get in touch, you can always find me on my Discord Server - [BeardedHome](https://discord.gg/W3xKtV) 

Also, you can try and get in touch while I'm streaming. There should be at least 1 stream each month!

### Integrations

There are too many integrations to list them all, but some of the main ones are:
- Telegram for notifications and control
- Zigbee2MQTT for controlling (and now also updating) my Zigbee devices
- Google for integration with Google Assistant and various Home devices
- Synology for Surveillence station and Synology system statistics and info
- HACS - Home Assistant Community Store - for even more custom components and plugins
- influxDB - storing data generated by Home Assistant
- OctoPrint - to see what my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer is doing

Etc.

## Folder structure and files

Insipred by [Frenck](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) I've broken my configuration in various files.

It looks overwhelming at first, but when you get the hang of it, this structure is much easier to maintain and find something. Also disabeling parts of the integrations is just a rename away :)
