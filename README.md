# BeardedTinker's Home Assistant configuration

Here is a shot on making my Home Assistant configuration available.
All individual files should have comments inside and I'll try to add as much documentation as I can over time.

## Want to get more info?

You can follow my YouTube channel (https://YouTube.com/BeardedTinker) for more information and video guides for various stuff that's included here.

## Folder structure and files

Insipred by [Frenck](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) I've broken my configuration in various files.

It looks overwhelming at first, but when you get the hang of it, this structure is much easier to maintain and find something. Also disabeling parts of the integrations is just a rename away :)
