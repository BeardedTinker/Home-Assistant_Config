### Intro

Here you can find all of the configuration files from my Home Assistant installation - main system or if you prefer to call it production enviroment. Updates are pushed whenever there is a change and I do try to work on the system as much as time allows. But lately it's been slow<br>
I wish to thank all of the Home Assistant community for being inspiration for lot of the things I did here.<br>
I tried to list original authors of the code or parts of the code I used, but if something is missing, I appologise.


## YouTube Channel?

A lot of integrations and automations have videos on my [YouTube channel](https://YouTube.com/BeardedTinker) - neraly 400 videos, with at least 250 of them being Home Assistant How To's. 

If you want to get in touch, you can always find me on Discord Server - [BeardedHome](https://discord.gg/HkxDRN6). 

Also, if you have time you can try and join me while streaming and there should be at 1 or 2 streams each month!

> Do you want to support me, you can do so by becoming my YouTube Channel member - just click [link here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuqokNoK8ZFNQdXxvlE129g/join) and select one of the membership levels - or go to my merchandise store and get something there!


### Hardware

Heart of my smart home is Home Assistant OS running in Virtual Machine on [Synology DSM920+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS920+) - DSM version 6.2.4.

Plugged in Synology is Zigbee USB CC2652RB stick from [slae.sh](https://slae.sh/projects/cc2652/) with Zigbee2mqtt firmware from Koenkk (Latest available firmware).

## Folder and files

Insipred by [Franck](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) I've broken my configuration in various files.

It looks overwhelming at first, but when you get the hang of it, this structure is much easier to maintain and find something. Also disabeling parts of the integrations is just a rename away :)
