## /scripts folder

Here you can find various scripts that are called from my automations.
As I mostly use system with vice and want voice response, I try to make random messages for same announcement - just to keep things unpredictable

  - almost_midnight - script is triggered at 23:30 to wanr me it's almost midnight, as I do tend to not sleep enough.
  - evening_light - trying to great everybody at home when it sunset
  - google_script - they are triggered when restarting HA 
  - midnight_lights_off - it's triggered when lights.off is executed for ALL lights.
  - play music/radio - are not used
  - pm10/pm25 are triggered when airquality is decreasing and under minimum expected level
  - schoolnight - you guessed - warning to go to bed
  - sunrise - good mornign script
  - telegram - actually not a speach, but enables me to pull current location of everyone in houshold via Telegram
